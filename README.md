# HTML Elements and Tags Lab 3 - Try it Yourself

## Description 📄
In this Try It Yourself activity, you'll be code detectives! We'll start with some classic, non-semantic HTML. Then, we'll leverage the power of generative AI to see how it suggests making the code more meaningful.  By the end, you'll be able to identify generic elements, grasp the power of semantic HTML, and build your own well-structured web pages using elements like `<nav>`, `<main>`, and `<section>`. Get ready to code like a pro!

**Attention**: When you complete a task, put an `x` in the middle of the brackets to mark it off your ToDo list.

1. [ ] Choose which generative AI you would like to use. 
2. [ ] Write a prompt using your prompt engineering skills that will ask the AI to refactor the HTML into semantic HTML for you. 
3. [ ] Note the changes that AI made to your document. 
   1. [ ] What is different? 
   2. [ ] What stayed the same?
